# WAF-GUARD

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **WAF-GUARD**, a powerful tool designed to assist in troubleshooting Web Application Firewall (WAF) configurations by leveraging an ontological representation.
This repository contains the source code and documentation necessary to understand and utilize WAF-GUARD.

## Overview

Configuring and maintaining a WAF, especially in large-scale environments, presents significant challenges due to the complexity and interconnectivity of rules and directives. WAF-GUARD addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive ontology that helps administrators navigate and manage complex WAF configurations efficiently.

## Features

- **Ontology-Based Representation**: Leverages ontology to model WAF configurations, enabling better traceability, transparency, and management.
- **Easy Navigation**: Facilitates the exploration of large rule sets, macros, and configurations through an intuitive interface.
- **Real-World Application**: Tested on extensive real-world configurations, demonstrating its effectiveness in diagnosing and resolving WAF configuration issues.
- **Commercial Integration**: WAF-GUARD is set to be included in the commercial solution of Company Y, extending its practical applications.

## Getting Started
